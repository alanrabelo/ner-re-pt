The data must be converted to the OpenNLP name finder training format. Which is one sentence per line. The sentence must be tokenized and contain spans which mark the entities. Documents are separated by empty lines which trigger the reset of the adaptive feature generators. A training file can contain multiple types. If the training file contains multiple types the created model will also be able to detect these multiple types. For now its recommended to only train single type models, since multi type support is stil experimental.

Sample sentence of the data:

<START:person> Pierre Vinken <END> , 61 years old , will join the board as a nonexecutive director Nov. 29 .
Mr . <START:person> Vinken <END> is chairman of Elsevier N.V. , the Dutch publishing group .
